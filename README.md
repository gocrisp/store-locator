# @gocrisp/store-locator

Store locator template page for use on any website. Intended for use with the Crisp GeoJSON connector.

## Example App

To run the example app locally, you need to build the npm package into `dist` and then run the example app. You can either run the store-locator code with `yarn dev` to watch for changes or build it once with `yarn build`, but with the former you will need to run `dev` and `example` simultaneously.

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn example
```

The example is automatically updated from the `main` branch and served here:
